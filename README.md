Capstone Project - Funnel Analysis
Swiggy Case- Study: As the Growth and Strategy Analyst at Swiggy, I undertook a comprehensive analysis of the company's performance in 2019, leveraging statistics and funnel analysis to generate actionable insights. With Swiggy being one of the largest food eCommerce platforms in the country, catering to over 1 million daily transactions, understanding, and optimizing the user journey was paramount to driving growth and strategic decision-making.
Firstly, conducted an in-depth examination of user acquisition and retention metrics to assess Swiggy's market penetration and customer loyalty. Utilizing statistical techniques, analyzed the growth rate of active users over time, identifying trends and patterns in user acquisition channels and campaign effectiveness. Additionally, delved into cohort analysis to understand user behaviour and retention rates, segmenting users based on their signup dates and tracking their engagement and transactional activities over time.
Next, employed funnel analysis to dissect the user journey from initial engagement to conversion, pinpointing potential drop-off points and optimization opportunities. By visualizing the conversion funnel and calculating key performance indicators such as conversion rates at each stage, I identified areas of friction and inefficiency in the user experience. This enabled me to propose targeted strategies to streamline the funnel, enhance user engagement, and drive conversion rates of present day with same day last week.
